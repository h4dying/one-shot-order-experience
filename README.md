# one-shot-order-experience
An app that lets users create rooms for their friends then they can push their orders to that room in order to let the admin of the room to order all the orders as one order in total.

## Why?
Everytime when me and my friends wanna order some foods for example, we take too much time to ask each one what they wanna eat and end up misunderstand each other orders, so, that's why I wanna create an app that somehow gather up everything then I can order the food as one shot experience to avoid misleading infos about their orders :trollface:	
## Overview
- A user can create room (and he will be the admin of that room).
- Each room has bunch of other users that can join using roomâ€™s code.
- each user can order some specific items and add their whole order to that room.
- the admin of the room can order the whole orders once which has all orders from other users on the room as well.
